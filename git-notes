3 states of GIT:
1. Working Directory:
   This is the actual directory on your local machine where you are working on your files.
       |
  git add -A 
       |
2. Staging Area:
   The staging area is a middle ground between your working directory and the Git repository. 
   Files in the staging area are ready to be committed.
   You can think of it as a snapshot of changes you want to include in your next commit.
          |
      git push origin 
          |
3. Committed/Git Repo:
   The changes in the staging area are saved as a new commit in the Git repository
   It will create a permanent record of your work.


Q. If you have pushed changes to a remote repository and you want to undo those changes:

Undo the Last Commit Locally: git log                         # Check the commit history and find the commit hash you want to revert to
                              git reset --hard <commit-hash>
Force Push to Remote: : git push -f origin <branch-name>

Mosh, short for "mobile shell," is a remote terminal application that enhances the capabilities of traditional SSH (Secure Shell) for remote access to Unix-like systems.

$1: This is a positional parameter representing the first command-line argument passed to the script or function. If you execute a script with an argument like ./script.sh Alice, where script.sh is the name of the script, then $1 will be replaced by "Alice". If no arguments are provided, $1 will be empty.

"wine" folder typically refers to the directory where Wine, a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, is installed.

"arp" command is used to view and manipulate the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC (Media Access Control) addresses on a local network.

vmstat command will show you virtual machine statistics:

%steal in cpu : <insert full explanation>

operating system will move inactive pages (blocks of data) from the physical RAM to the swap space. 
This process is known as paging or swapping out.

[Mounting a disk: full process]:
1. lsblk: list all block devices attached to server with dev/sdX
2. partition disk: sudo fdisk /dev/sdb         	Type n to create a new partition.
						Choose p for primary partition.
						Enter 1 for the first partition number.
						Choose the default first sector (press Enter).
						Type +500G to create a partition of 500GB.
						Type w to write the changes to the disk.

3. format the partitions: sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
4. Create Mount Points /folders: mkdir mfgpro
5. mount the partitions: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mfgpro
6. Make the Mounts Persistent (partition auto add after boot), you need to add them in /etc/fstab:
   6A: get uuid of partitions: blkid /dev/sdb1
   6B: add it in fstab: <UUID1>  /mfgpro  ext4  defaults  0  2
7. Verify the Mounts: mount -a ; df -h

Command Success

if command; then : Executes the if block if command returns an exit status of 0 (success).
Command Failure

if ! command; then : Executes the if block if command returns a non-zero exit status (failure).

Arithmetic Evaluations

[ $(( expression )) -eq 0 ] : Evaluates arithmetic conditions.
(( expression )) : A more compact way to evaluate arithmetic conditions.
Advanced Conditional Expressions

[[ ]] : Used for more powerful pattern matching and string comparisons.
[ ] : The traditional test command (less powerful than [[ ]]).

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
if above command is successful, then exit code would be 0.

Each core is capable of executing its own instructions and performing tasks independently from other cores.
Each core can also have multiple threads, which are the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler.

keyless connection between 2 servers:
1: Generate an SSH Key Pair
2. ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3. Copy the SSH Public Key to the Remote Server(~/.ssh/authorized_keys): ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote_server_ip
4. same steps for other server if you want to create connection both ways.
5. generate public key and store it in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of remote server.

ssh-keygen: command will generate private and public key.
Public key is used to encrypt data that only the corresponding private key can decrypt.
Private key is used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key.

authorized_keys: Stores public keys of the devices that are allowed to access your account.
known_hosts: Keeps fingerprints of remote servers you’ve connected to.
known_hosts.old: A backup of the known_hosts file.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f ~/my-aws-key.pem
it will generate pvt (pem) keys and pub keys in home directory.
put pub keys in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in order to allow logins from this pub key



rpm, yum, and dnf:
1. RPM (Red Hat Package Manager):It does not resolve dependencies automatically. You need to manually install all required dependencies.
   RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.
2. YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified): works on top of rpm to automatically resolves and installs dependencies for the package being installed.
   RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.
3. DNF (Dandified YUM): dnf is the next-generation version of yum. same as yum but improved performance, better dependency resolution.
   dnf uses the libsolv library for faster and more accurate dependency resolution.
4. apt (advanced package tool): Used in Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu.
5. Zypper: Used in openSUSE.
   zypper install <package-name>

Installing application from source code:
Download the source code, usually a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2
Extract the archive:
- tar -xzf <file-name>.tar.gz

go to specified directory:
- cd <extracted-directory>

"configure" file comes with downloaded source code. Running ./configure checks system if it has required tools and libs needed to build software.
It sets up a "Makefile" (used by make command) with the right paths & config. for your system.
- ./configure

make compiles the source code into executable files. make command takes the instructions from the Makefile and starts building (compiling) the software.
converts human-readable source code (like .c or .cpp files) into machine-readable code (binaries).
- make

Installs the compiled software system-wide.
- sudo make install


disabling root login on Linux:
1. Open the SSH configuration file:
2. Find the line PermitRootLogin says: PermitRootLogin no
3. systemctl restart sshd

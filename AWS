ALB uses host and path-based routing and NLB just route you to any available nodes that are quickly available.
It looks at things like hostnames (like www.example.com) or URLs (like /rollercoaster or /waterslides).
It’s focused on speed and efficiency. It doesn’t care about the details of the request (like which ride or page someone wants). 
It just sends the request to whichever server (or "node") is available and able to handle it quickly

AWS SAA:
THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW:
whenever cost effectiveness is mentioned, they dont even want a single resource available i.e. they want ecs/fargate and aurora for DB and lambda function
NO autoscaling or k8s since they require on resource.
whenever high availability is mentioned, they want autoscaling, multi availabilty zone/region and k8s stuff.
whenever security is mentioned, aws inspector, guarduty, shield, WAF, firewall manager, 

what is trust policy in aws
ENI,AWS Shield, AWS Direct connection
diff DR strategies: pilot light, warm standby w.r.t rto
RPO and RTO
burstable instance
ecs, fargate, aurora
vpc peering, site-site
The only way to retrieve instance metadata is to use the link-local address, which is 169.254.169.254.
all s3 options (remember timings), multipart uploads, 
sticky session, session affinity, cooldown period, deregistration delay

Fargate is more similar to Kubernetes than Docker because both Fargate and Kubernetes are container orchestration systems.

ECS is more similar to Docker in the sense that Docker is the containerization technology, 
and ECS is an orchestration platform that manages and runs Docker containers at scale. 
ECS allows you to deploy, manage, and scale Docker containers across multiple servers (EC2 instances).

AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code without having to manage servers. 
It automatically runs your code in response to events, such as uploading a file to S3, updating a database, or receiving an HTTP request.
it's helpful for doing automated tasks / event driven tasks without having your own infra. 
it is aws native hence support s3 events, dynamodb events (CRUD), sns, sqs, cloudwatch, cloudformation, rds events, etc.


AWS IAM:
actions  -->  policy  --> role --> user/iam group/server

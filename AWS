ALB uses host and path-based routing and NLB just route you to any available nodes that are quickly available.
It looks at things like hostnames (like www.example.com) or URLs (like /rollercoaster or /waterslides).
It’s focused on speed and efficiency. It doesn’t care about the details of the request (like which ride or page someone wants). 
It just sends the request to whichever server (or "node") is available and able to handle it quickly

Docker:
docker's alpine based images like busybox gives you default crontab for 15mins , daily, hourly, monthly, weekly. so you can keep that in mind while writing/config dockerfile.
you can use docker commit to create docker image from running container, so it will avoid dockerfile approach and can make container ready image.
go inside container and use env command to check base image and more info about docker.
you can check bin file of the base image to check which commands are executable and which needs to be added using package manager.
docker run -d <image_name> tail -f /dev/null
The tail -f /dev/null command effectively makes the container wait forever without doing anything. This will keep the container running until you stop it manually.
